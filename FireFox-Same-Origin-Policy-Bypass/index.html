<h1>FireFox Same Origin Policy Bypass</h1>
<br>

<p>
This was my first ever (valid) Firefox bug, I must say I was lucky to find it. What I did when I first started finding bugs within the Firefox browser was to read carefully what is actually considered a bug.<br>
One of bugs are Cross-Origin Policy bypasses, essentially there are security measures to prevent say <code>http://yourdomain.ltd</code> to read data (like document.cookie, or document.body.innerHTML ..etc) from an external website like 
<code>http://facebook.com/</code> as this is obviously dangerous. Because if this was allowed, I could just have you visit my website and behind your back I could read your facebook messages or emails which is a huge privacy concern.<br>
<br>
The first thing I did and I suggest everyone who wants to find a bug in a browser like Firefox is to read read read read read read. You have to understand or atleast be aware of different functions in order to test them. A big help to me as well was looking at older valid bug reports.<br>
All you need to do then is to test your crazy theory. I probably went through dozens of failed tests before I stumbled on this bypass, I was just reading the Mozilla documentation on various javascript functions. To make it easier for me at first as there are a lot of javascript functions,
 I first targeted only the javascript functions which made HTTP requests, among these was the fetch() api, and after various tests with it, I tried to use an old trick (which has been done before I believe) of trying a 302 redirection. So I would host say a PHP file on my 'evil' website, all it did was redirect to say 'facebook.com' doing so somehow tricked the fetch function.<br><br>
 But it didn't trick all of the fetch function, it was required that certain things were passed alongside the function, which were {mode:'no-cors',credentials: 'include'} these optional passed variables basically told the fetch API to fetch the external document without CORS (AKA Cross Origin Resource Sharing) as well as make sure to send a credentialed request (which sends the request as if you were logged in). Doing both of those things made this bug that more dangerous.
 <br>The following will be the exact PoC code I submitted to Mozilla on my report.
